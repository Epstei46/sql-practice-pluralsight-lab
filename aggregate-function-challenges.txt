4	Hattie McDaniel         USA
5	John Stamos	            USA

Tasks:
(1) Write a query that returns the total number of actors in the Actors table.
(2) Let's add a WHERE clause to filter the result set. Go ahead and filter the results to only count American actors.

Answer:
SELECT count(*) FROM Actors WHERE country = 'USA';

Olivia de Havilland	Japan	30000
Hattie McDaniel	    USA	    45000
NULL	            USA	    10000

Olivia de Havilland	Japan	30000
Hattie McDaniel	    USA	    45000

Tasks:
(1) Write a query that calculates the average salary for all actors in our Actors table.
(2) Now filter the query in order to calculate the average of only American actors.

Answer:
SELECT avg(salary) FROM Actors WHERE country = 'USA';

Challenge: Filtering Aggregates:
                Actors
name	                country	salary	role
Vivien Leigh	        IN	    150000	leading
Clark Gable	            USA	    120000	leading
Olivia de Havilland	    Japan	30000	leading
Hattie McDaniel	        USA	    45000	supporting
Leslie Howard	        UK	    50000	leading
Alicia Rhett	        USA	    97000	supporting
Lillian Kemble-Cooper	UK	    95000	supporting

Tasks:
(1) Use the GROUP BY clause to write a query that returns the country name and total salary paid to actors for each country.
(2) Now use the HAVING clause to add a filter so that only countries with more than 1 actor are returned from our SQL query.
(3) Lastly, letâ€™s add a condition to filter only actors with a supporting role. This condition will need to be run before the grouping of records happen.

Answer:
SELECT country, sum(salary)
FROM Actors WHERE role = 'supporting'
GROUP BY country HAVING count(*) > 1;
